# lets-git-it
Think Git is too difficult to use? Don't worry. Let's Git it. â˜º

## Prerequisites
* A GitHub account.
* Willingness to learn.
* Some free time.

In case you haven't got an account yet, you can [create a new account](https://github.com/join).

Get started:
1. Open a new Terminal/Powershell/CMD prompt/Git Bash.
2. Copy the command

	`git clone https://github.com/Rapteon/lets-git-it.git`
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Or open the repository in a Git GUI client.
4. You'll notice that the repo is up-to-date with this repo.
5. Using a text editor, make changes to the files based on the following rules:
   - You are working on a space elevator construction team.
   - As a part of your daily assignment, you are given a list of tasks to be completed.
   - Each task is written in the form of a simple text file. An example has been given in the *rapteon* folder.
   - Each task file exists in a folder named after you, and the filename is the date on which the task list was assigned. The file is a markdown file.
   - Mark each task as done by placing a '- [x]' before the beginning of the line in your file. Incomplete tasks can be marked by '- [ ]' at the beginning.
6. You will be required to make a new folder with your GitHub username (or pseudonym), and create a new task file in the folder. All tasks mentioned in the file must not be marked as completed yet.
7. Commit this file.
8. Play with the list of tasks, marking some of them as completed. You can even mark them as incomplete.
9. When you become comfortable with committing changes, try creating a new branch and editing someone else's task.
10. In case you want to add your list of tasks to this main repo, create a pull request.

In case you aren't familiar with markdown files, [this guide may help](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).
